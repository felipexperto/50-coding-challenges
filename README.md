- Try to solve at least 1 coding challenge per day
- Any solution that you find is a good solution… we are not looking for the perfect solution
- For convenience, when you work on these challenges, you can use an online coding
playground, such as the one from https://codeguppy.com
- Share your solutions on Twitter with hashtag #codeguppy
- Feel free to share this booklet with your friends and invite them to complete the coding
challenges
- This booklet contains also all the solutions to these challenges
- Have fun!
